# IPL-2023-SCORE-PREDICTOR
Predicting Winner of the INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE(IPL) 2023 using Python and Data Science.
Here I gathered data by web-scaping it from Wikipedia and official IPL databases, using python and stored them in CSV file.
Used the data systematically to predict the number of runs scored by each team in their first innings using Linear Regression and Ridge Regression.
